					"devnotes": "Shoalstill is a harbor city that sits atop an unmoving complex of rock formations in the far western region known as the Tidelands. The defiantdefying ebb and flow of the Western Sea creates daily tides that stretch a great length inland, far past the city walls of Shoalstill. The next day, as the tide recedes back to the sea, a new geography is left behind. Created from dried sand, mineral, and crag, newly-created canyons and rivers flow inland from the shore in an unpredictable maze. Shoalstill residents call these Fingerprints, because no landscape is the same as it was the day before. 

Resting securely atop this geographical dynamic is Shoalstill. The network of hardrock that the city was built upon seems to be the only secure location in the constantly moving  Tidelands. The harbor city connects directly to the ocean by viaduct, ensuring that the harbor and the branching canals are always filled with water, regardless of the surrounding area. This viaduct may run flat with the ocean level one day, then tower high above it the next. This connection is one of the only ways one can hope to leave behind the Western Sea and head inland. 

The city is drab, almost constantly set behind a thick layer of fog that rolls off the mountains that stop the Tidelands from moving further inland. But at its core, Shoalstill is a shining testament to Materia’s might. After the Fall, the followers of the school needed a way to hold a fortifiedcated area near the great city, while still allowing for an accessible trading post that other settlements could reach. The standing city was their solution. 

Once ships sail through the viaduct and arrive at the central market, they can stay and trade before heading out to sea, or they can use Shoalstill’s intricate, strong pulley system to pass over the forming tides and onto the mouth of the Saqinthaw river. While there’s no rules stating that you have to use the city to pass through the tidelands, there are few ships that are light enough to make it through without bottoming out on the constantly moving tides. And if someone falls overboard, well, there’s a chance that they’re already buried.

While the leaders of Materia call the shots around Shoalstill, the followers of Minerva also see the city’s great utility--not because of its fortification or trade routes, but because of what lies underneath. 

With each new tide comes forgotten relics of old that then become trapped within that day’s Fingerprint. Minerva’s followers trawl the newly-formed rivers every day in secrecy, hoping to find relics that were once lost below the sea. While the followers of Materia allowed this to continue for some time--though never officially approved, the city is starting to feel the effects of erosion and density. With such fruition comes the need for a strengthened infrastructure, and many of the higher members of the school feel that the soggy followers of Minerva are taking away what could strengthen the city. If anything, their constant digging and netting is only making things worse. 

But the followers of Minerva feel otherwise. In fact, they believe they may one day uncover the key to solidifying the city into the rock and making it a bastion for all. Well, mostly for followers of Minerva, but they may let others in too. Dug very deeply into this belief, the Minervan’s have annexed a portion of the city-a standalone part of the shoal only connected by bridge. While no blood has been shed, it’s clear that it’s not far from happening. With the two schools at each other's throat as they vie for power of the standing city, you must choose a side. 

Potential Battle Areas 

The Corpus- Underneath Shoalstill, in the hardrock that keeps the city alive, is a honeycomb-like network of caves. As each day’s tide changes which entrances are available, then this could serve well as our repeating quest that we talked about. Each day, a new entrance, a new fight. This has great potential for a daily quest/reward scheme: perhaps a series of opponents along with a chance of cards- common or rare.
The Drowned Citadel
	Somewhere within the Corpus lies the ruins of an old fortress pre-dating the Fall. Swallowed by stone and sand, the fort is full of unreadable, waterlogged tomes, decaying furniture, ruined tapestries and rusted suits of armor. But so too is it full of ancient objects of immense values. Tomes of forgotten knowledge, magical artifacts, and more traditionally desirable trinkets. 
The Citadel is the heart of a once-sprawling metropolis largely washed away by time and tide alike. Its structure is carved into a limestone bedrock like an anthill, and inlaid with stone bricks that give it a civilized ambience. As a consequence of the ever-shifting tides, much of the citadel is flooded and inaccessible at any given time. 
Each day unearths the way to new chambers, while swallowing paths to others. The occasional skeleton of a drowned scavenger reminds those who come to steal the citadel’s riches just how quickly the magnificent halls and passages can transform into tombs.

The Stilters- A group of pirates have come to understand the tides better than most. Using a flotilla of lightweight rafts, the pirates attack any ship brave enough (and small enough) that attempts to pass through the tidelands without going through Shoalstill. When the tides recede, the Stilters dig into the canyons as they form and become a stilted campground until the next tide.
