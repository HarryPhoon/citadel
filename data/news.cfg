"<font size='+50%'>Some new features</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>April 30, 2016</i></font>
As part of our new UI effort we have added a little bundle of new features:

<b>Recent Games</b>&emdash;Click on <i>Recent Games</i> under your profile to review your recent games and even watch replays of them.
<b>Levels</b>&emdash;As you play you earn experience which causes you to level up. Your level reflects your skill and dedication to <i>Argentum Age</i>.
<b>News</b>&emdash;Well, this is a bit meta, but as you can see we have added this news section which lets you see what's going on with the game.
<b>Daily Quests</b>&emdash;You will be assigned quests which provide you with gold and experience rewards upon completion. Complete quests to be assigned more difficult quests with bigger rewards!
<b>AI Difficulty Levels</b>&emdash;We want the AI to be challenging, but also to offer a fair and fun experience to new players. So now we have different difficulty levels for the AI. Adjust the AI to your preferred level of challenge.

"<font size='+50%'>New chat system!</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>April 30, 2016</i></font>
The chat system has been re-worked and updated. Chat with your friends between or during games, join different channels, and use emojis. Here's a quick little primer:

<b>/join #channel</b>&emdash;this will join the channel called '#channel'.
<b>/whisper David hello!</b>&emdash;send me a private message saying hello. I love to chat to players and hear about your experiences, so please actually do this.
<b>#channel hi</b>&emdash;send a message to the channel '#channel'

The emojis you're familiar with are available too. You know, things like :) becoming <img src='images/icons/emoji/smile.svg'/> and :( becoming <img src='images/icons/emoji/frown.svg'/>.",
