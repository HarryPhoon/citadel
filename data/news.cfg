<font size='+50%'>Some Small Tweaks</font>
<font size='-10%'><i>Sep 7, 2017</i></font>
A variety of cards have been tweaked lately, including making the 'hero' cards a little less powerful.

You can now move individual creatures by clicking on them if you want to choose the order in which creatures move. Buying now works in both possible views in the library.

We have reworked the <font tag='obj:card:Treant Sapling'>Treant Sapling</font>. It starts out as a piddling little 3/3 for 3, but each turn that you keep it in your hand it grows a little larger. How long will you keep it in your hand before deciding it's time to unleash it on the battlefield?
