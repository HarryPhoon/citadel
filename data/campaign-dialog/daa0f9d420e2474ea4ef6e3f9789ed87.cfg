As you lay in the dust, the leader pulls you to your knees by your hair. &ldquo;Look&rdquo; he growls menacingly. Before you, like some morbid reflection, is the pilgrim, also on his knees. He moans the beginning of one last plea. &ldquo;Pleas-&rdquo;. His throat is slit in one smooth motion, from ear to ear. As he lies in a rapidly expanding pool of blood, softly gurgling, the leader lets go of your hair. He gives you one last kick in the ribs for good measure. A member of the mercenary band looks over the body. &ldquo;Little sh&#8217;t weren&#8217;t lyin&#8217;. He didn&#8217;t have nothin&#8217; on &#8216;im.&rdquo; Another pipes up. &ldquo;Hey we still got that coin from the last one right? Let&#8217;s go to th&#8217; tavern. I heard that good-lookin&#8217; bitch Alice is servin&#8217; tonight.&rdquo; The leader gives you one last murderous look, then sheaves his blade. &ldquo;Right you are Tommy. Let&#8217;s go lads.&rdquo;"
