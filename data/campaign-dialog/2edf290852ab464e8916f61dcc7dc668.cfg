You don&#8217;t seem to remember him ever being there- you&#8217;re finding it hard even remembering what he looks like. &ldquo;Well? Don&#8217;t just stand there you pissheads, let&#8217;s go find &#8217;im!&rdquo; Derwin simply stands there, mouth wide open, his face sheet-white. &ldquo;Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.&rdquo; You&#8217;re surrounded."
