One in particular among the rest can be heard barking orders. &ldquo;Check for survivors! Orders were clear, no witnesses!&rdquo; Furiously wiping away your tears, you rush to your feet. With a yell, you sprint out through the open door, past heavily armoured men, weapons drawn, who start back in surprise at your entrance. As you run with all your might, clambering aboard your horse as quick as you can, you hear the same voice again screaming orders. &ldquo;Seize them! Don&#8217;t let them get away!&rdquo; But by then it is already too late; twitching the reins and driving your ankles fiercely into the horse&#8217;s sides, you set off at a pounding gallop."
