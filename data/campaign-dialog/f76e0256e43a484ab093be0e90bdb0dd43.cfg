	"text": "Despite his apparent weariness, the driver guffaws heartily. &ldquo;Hah! No doubt.&rdquo; He lowers his voice, now just a hint of a smile on his face. &ldquo;You&#8217;d be best to keep those sorts of opinions to yourself from now on; else they may get you in a lot of trouble.&rdquo; The driver motions off to the side, where a long queue of people, carts, livestock, and produce stand in line next to a much smaller, discreet, slightly battered and worn looking, gate. &ldquo;The Merchant&#8217;s gate!&rdquo; He says, rather loudly.  &ldquo;Those big ones there are called the &#8217;Gates of War&#8217;. Takes half a day to open them, another half to shut &#8217;em. Needless to say, they&#8217;re not hugely practical! Heck, i&#8217;ve heard they&#8217;ve only been opened twice in the last century. Anyhow, we&#8217;d best get in that queue or else be locked out for the night.&rdquo;"
