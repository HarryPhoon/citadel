	"text": "Silent footsteps bring you closer as your ears prick up. A singular female voice. Young but commanding looms from the darkness. &ldquo;Where is the Sleeper? Tell me, or meet the fate of your family.&rdquo; There is a pleading reply, and then a sickening thud. &ldquo;Useless. Leave them, the tides shall cleanse their heathen bodies.&rdquo; Their footsteps quickly fade and you hasten forward. 

Before you lie a group of bodies. Badly beaten and tortured before death. Their ends must not have been pleasant. There is a spluttering as one grabs you as you kneel down. &ldquo;Do not... let them free... the Sleeper.&rdquo; His breathing is shallow and his eyes flicker behind you. &ldquo;Hurry.&rdquo;"
