This street, you know to be the Leafweave&emdash;a fact simply proven by the large wrought iron fence that towers before you. Entwined in and around the wall of metal spires are ancient vines that look stronger than any axe could ever hope to sever. This is the fence to the Madrigal Grand Arboretum."
