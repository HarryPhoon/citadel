We&#8217;ve come away with a fine haul, and this fella don&#8217;t look like no moralising dandy!&rdquo; By now, they are but a short distance away and you can see the taller one scowling at his short companion as they stop before you. A third man stands quietly beside them. &ldquo;S&#8217;not people i&#8217;m worried about takin&#8217; notice of us you daft fuck&#8230;&rdquo; The taller one&#8217;s voice trails off as his head jerks around, surveying the empty plain. &ldquo;Look, let&#8217;s just go alri-&rdquo;. The smaller one interrupts him. &ldquo;Ah come on Bran- where&#8217;re your manners! How&#8217;d you do fella? What&#8217;re you doin&#8217; out here anyhow?&rdquo;"
