<i>Well met, stranger</i> one of them says, approaching you, <i>The servants of Rihn seek new disciples, especially those with the power to defeat our adversaries, the evil unbelievers who crave nothing but worldly knowledge. We understand you have traveled here with the School of Illyrium, but will you swear allegiance to the Almighty Goddess and join our side to defeat them?</i>"
