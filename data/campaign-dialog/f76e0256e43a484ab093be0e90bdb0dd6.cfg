	"text": "After walking along the dusty trail for quite some time, clothes damp with sweat, you begin to make out the hazy shape of a large cart. Two large horses stand ahead of it, yoked in by sturdy harnesses, tails lazily slapping away the numerous flies that buzz around them. When you finally reach it, you collapse in the shade with some relief. After a few moments, you climb aboard, entering the cool darkness inside. A few darkened faces suspiciously peer at you as you blink rapidly; eyes getting accustomed. A squat, rather wide man leaps surprisingly nimbly off the bench at the far end, eyebrows raised like two fat slugs. You fear at first they may slither away; for his head is completely bald. He notes your staring and clears his throat pointedley. &ldquo;May I help you?&rdquo;"
