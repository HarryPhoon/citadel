A neatly painted sign above the stall reads in flowing cursive &#8216;Avi&#8217;s Bounteous Bazaar&#8217;. Beneath is a stall, overflowing with a mish-mash of colourful items, it&#8217;s owner catching your eye. &ldquo;Welcome friend!&rdquo; The slight man hops over a heap of shiny baubles with a flourish, standing before you with the slightest inclination of his head. &ldquo;I am Avi, my friend, and you, you have come to the right place! It is now only fair that, in return, Avi does what he can for you!&rdquo;"
