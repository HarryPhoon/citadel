	"text": "You hoist the sack containing your sparse belongings over one shoulder, before stepping off the porch and onto the dirt track. You eagerly set off, following the winding trail that meanders through the fields. After walking for a few minutes, you turn around to gaze at the farmhouse one last time. From a distance, it seems strangely small and insignificant amongst the vast fields that surround it. Yet, even as you think this, you feel a great fondness for it nonetheless. You&#8217;re scarcely outside the farm&#8217;s perimeter fence, yet this is the farthest you&#8217;ve been from home. However, you feel eager to press on and explore what the world outside has to offer."
