He straightens up, wiping at his brow. &ldquo;Damn thing near took one of the wheels off!&rdquo; He pants, sweat forming into large droplets on the end of his chin. &ldquo;Strange. Not sure how it got on the trail in the first place. Say, could you give me a hand? With two of us we can get this thing out of the way in no time.&rdquo;"
