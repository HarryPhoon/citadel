	"text": "The HUB is shapeless, its form depends on the mind of the shaper. Here, with an ease like nowhere else, a shaper can mold the reality around but unlike in the material world of the multiverse the shapes are formed only for a brief moment and if left without attention they will instantly disolve or evolve, change into something new. After centuries the shapers have observed that some of the forms are more likely, more prevalent or just tend to converge on similar, for lack of a better word - shape. The Ancient Scripture is one of those convergent points. It takes the form of old books written in an in-comprehensive language, in-comprehensive even for the shapers. Some other time known words and symbols are aligned into blocks that have no meaning. One of the challenges of the HUB is to decipher the scripture. As everything in the HUB the unlocking of the secrets can take many forms. 

You chose to deal with the challenge as a metaphor of a fight."
