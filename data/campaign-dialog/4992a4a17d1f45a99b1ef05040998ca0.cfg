	"text": "Searching amongst the bleak desert of the [[Crease]] you hear two voices raised in anger nearby. Moving quickly you peer over a bleached coral reef wash up to shore and spot the source of the argument. A man, clad in metal armor, his face red from exertion gestures at a woman in tattered blue robes. Once regal, they have faded in the blistering sun.

&ldquo;Step away [[Shoalwalker]], the land is ours by right, as are any Testaments that are revealed here. I&#8217;ve signaled for the Architect already.&rdquo; says the man, hand resting on the sword by his side. 

The woman shakes her head, her eyes narrowing. &ldquo;These lands are open, and I was here first. Leave and find your own relics, the tide comes and my Master will be here soon.&rdquo; 

You pause considering your options."
