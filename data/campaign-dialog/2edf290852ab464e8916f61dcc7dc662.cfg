	"text": "A breeze blows across the plain, the air resists. You are at once greeted by a peculiar silence; it flows sluggishly around stilled banners that have been planted in the ground for countless years. The ground speaks not a word, but if it could, it would moan; its surface scarred by sharp things, swords, spears, arrows. The silence is broken, by coarse laughter. The sound grates on dead ears, it is a revulsive sound, a sound for the living, it has no place here. Ahead of you now, you can see three men, each slightly bent-over under the weight of the plunder that they carry. Grave robbers. One of them sees you, he shouts something cheery. It is lost to the deafening silence that steadily gnaws at you.
