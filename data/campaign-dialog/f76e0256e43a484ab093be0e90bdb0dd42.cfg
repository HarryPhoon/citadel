	"text": "&ldquo;Hah. I&#8217;m surprised they didn&#8217;t prepare a procession in your honour too. No, no, we&#8217;re going through those other gates there.&rdquo; The driver motions off to the side, where a long queue of people, carts, livestock, and produce stand in line next to a much smaller, discreet, slightly battered and worn looking, gate. He chuckles at your bewildered expression. &ldquo;The Merchant&#8217;s gate. Those big ones there are called the &#8217;Gates of War&#8217;. Takes half a day to open them, another half to shut &#8217;em; so needless to say they&#8217;re not hugely practical. Heck, i&#8217;ve heard they&#8217;ve only been opened twice in the last century! Anyhow, we&#8217;d best get in that queue or else be locked out for the night.&rdquo;"
