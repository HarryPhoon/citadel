	"text": "You are victorious! The Bandits obviously weren&#8217;t ready for the fight you gave them, and they soon stream back into the safety of the woods, battered and bruised. You, Pete, and the passengers alike cheer as you throw insults and jeers at their retreating backs. &ldquo;Good riddance!&rdquo; Shouts Pete, before collapsing to his knees, huffing. &ldquo;Been a long time since I was in action&#8230;&rdquo; He wheezes, loudly. &ldquo;I can&#8217;t say we would have gotten through that without your leadership, kid.&rdquo; He gives you a warm pat on the back. &ldquo;Well done.&rdquo; He begins gathering the horses together, retying them into their harnesses when he stops- mid-knot- mouth agape. &ldquo;Is that smoke?&rdquo; Puzzled, you look back the way you came and your heart sinks in your chest. Pete hurriedly tugs at the loop that holds the harness shut, freeing one of them. &ldquo;Quickly! Take a horse! We&#8217;re only five miles out, you can make it if you hurry!&rdquo;"
