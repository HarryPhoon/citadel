	"text": "As you continue forwards, a dark fog begins to swirl and flicker at the peripheries of your vision. It&#8217;s loud, too loud, the noise rattles within your skull; the drums pound on your ears. You are surrounded by soldiers, you struggle to distinguish friend from foe. They have all begun to look the same. Frightened men roaring at one another, their faction colours blurring into one, dyed a deep red."
