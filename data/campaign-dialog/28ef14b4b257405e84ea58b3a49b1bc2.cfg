	"text": "In the backstreets of Shoalstill you are approached by a strange character, a Soothsayer of the Entropians. <i>Greetings, oh shaper</i> he begins, <i>My lord has an interesting proposal for you. The mercenary companies from Proudspire are ravaging Irehndal. Pain and suffering are the norm under their rule, in this land which was once peaceful and absent of human life.</i>

A chill goes down your spine at his smile before he continues. <i>They are disgusting things, cruel and vile, the mercenaries, causing conflicts, allowing life to thrive where there should be none. I would be happy to take you there, to fight the evil mercenaries, the barbaric armies of lords and kings. In exchange the Entropians will provide you with spells and henchmen to aid you.</i>"
