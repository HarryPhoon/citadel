	"text": "You lie atop his warm body, exhausted. The last of your strength has left you. You roll off him, lie beside him, in the gore, the soiled earth. Another figure emerges from the fog. They stumble forwards towards you, and you have no strength left to defend yourself. His face becomes clear as he stands atop you, looking down at you. He is but a boy, his weapon naught more than a pitchfork. The boy yells at the top of his lungs, a shout that emerges as a shrill whimper. He brings the pitchfork down, down into the crease between your breastplate and helmet, a join where the neck is unprotected. The prongs penetrate your throat, the coarse metal spikes sinking into your flesh, easing, sliding through, severing your windpipe."
