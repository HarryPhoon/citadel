	"text": "A sharp bump wakes you, and you pitch forward, sweating. You can hear the echoing clack of hooves on cobbles. A road? You stumble out through the front flap, climbing up alongside Pete. He gives you a strained smile. He looks worn out. You now notice the smell. It hits you like a wall, a fetid stench that cloys in your nostrils. Covering your mouth, you look around you, and a wave of nausea hits you as you take in the ghastly scenery. On either side of the road, for miles behind and ahead, there are hundreds of corpses. Some are impaled on stakes, some hung from the odd tree, as many as each branch can fit. Others have simply been left atop one another, heaped piles cresting the tops of the ditches that run on both sides of the road. &ldquo;Ain&#8217;t pretty is it?&rdquo; Pete&#8217;s expression is indecipherable as the cart rolls steadily along. &ldquo;Makes you wonder, doesn&#8217;t it? Whether all this suffering is worth the cost.&rdquo; He sighs. &ldquo;Anyway, look up ahead. We&#8217;re here.&rdquo;"
