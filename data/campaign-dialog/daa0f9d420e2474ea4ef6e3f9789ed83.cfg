We gotta do what we do to survive: Those god&#8217; o&#8217; yours don&#8217;t give a piss about us.&rdquo; The pilgrim looks at you in horror, as he tries to form the beginnings of one last plea. &ldquo;Pleas-&rdquo;. He&#8217;s roughly beaten and restrained, on his knees. His throat is slit in one smooth motion, from ear to ear. As he lies in a rapidly expanding pool of blood, softly gurgling, the leader gives you a cheery grin. &ldquo;Little sh&#8217;t weren&#8217;t lyin&#8217;. He didn&#8217;t have nothin&#8217; on &#8216;im, except for this weird card-thingy. Go on, &#8216;av it.&rdquo; A member of the band pipes up. &ldquo;Hey we still got that coin from the last one right? Let&#8217;s go to th&#8217; tavern. I heard that good-lookin&#8217; bitch Alice is servin&#8217; tonight.&rdquo; The leader gives you a last wave as he and his men filter out of the church ruins. &ldquo;Right you are Tommy! Let&#8217;s go lads.&rdquo;"
