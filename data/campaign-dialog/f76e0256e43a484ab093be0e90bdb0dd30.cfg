	"text": "The smoke is like a persistent fog as you jump off the horse and run towards the farmhouse door. Your eyes are already streaming and your throat constricting as you throw open the door. The hinges scream as a dense blanket of dark smoke roils outwards towards the sky, enveloping you in an ashen cloud. You begin to choke, head pounding as you drop to your knees, hurriedly breathing in the clean air beneath the smoke. From your prone position, you scan the kitchen for any sign of your father. The smoke within clears briefly, and you make out his shape, sat slumped over against the far wall."
