	"text": "The stalls are of little interest, their wares likely junk, their owners likely thieves. You instead head in the direction of a small stage which houses a musical act. As you near, the ensemble becomes clearer: first the music descends upon you, it lifts your spirits, and you feel a silly urge to dance. The festive sound matches the wondrous display; jugglers juggle, a firespitter breathes flame, and an acrobat performs dizzying somersaults, flips and handstands across the stage. There is thunderous applause as the act ends, each performer bowing in turn. By now, you are in the crowd and the acrobat springs off stage before the crowd, proffering an empty hat to people in turn. People are throwing in small change one by one, until the hat reaches you."
