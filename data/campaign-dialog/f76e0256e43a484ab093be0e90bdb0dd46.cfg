He shambles off into the adjacent guard post, and you can hear some loud rummaging along with a couple of colourful curse-words as there is sound of a small avalanche. Finally, he emerges, handing you a small, yet weighty, letter. As he drops it in your outstretched palm it jingles softly, and you are aware of the many eyes fixed upon it. You drop it into one of your belt pouches, securing it firmly out of sight. The guard looks evermore annoyed; perhaps realising that he could have relieved that letter of its contents without anyone&#8217;s knowing. &ldquo;Move along&rdquo; he mutters. You and Pete clamber back atop the cart and you head through the open gate, into the city streets beyond."
