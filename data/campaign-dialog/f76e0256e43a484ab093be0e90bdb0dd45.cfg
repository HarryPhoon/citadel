	"text": "Time seems to crawl by as you cling onto the saddle, thundering away down the trail. Eventually, you manage to slow to a trot, realising there&#8217;s no pursuit. After some time, you reach the stranded cart, the driver standing in front of it with a relieved smile on his face. It evaporates away when he sees you stiffly dismount, stumbling dazedly towards him. Without a word, he pulls a blanket off a protesting passenger, wrapping it around you firmly before sitting you down in the back of the cart. As the adrenaline wears off, you feel an ache in your body, and an overwhelming feeling of grief. The tears run freely, until you can cry no more. The sobs wrack your body, and for once the other passengers are mute. Eventually, the exhaustion overcomes you and you drift off into a restless sleep."
