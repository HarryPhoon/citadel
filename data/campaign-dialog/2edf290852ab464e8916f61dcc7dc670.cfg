	"text": "You barely manage to hold your own; the ghouls are ferocious, but back away once it becomes clear they can&#8217;t overwhelm you with numbers. They leave the corpses of their brethren as they slink away back into the ancient battlefield. A short distance away, Bran kneels on the ground, cradling the lifeless body of his brother. You can only recognize him by his clothes, his features have otherwise been torn apart beyond recognition. You start to move toward Bran to console him, but he stares up at you with a look of cold fury. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t come any fuckin&#8217; closer.&rdquo; He chokes back tears. &ldquo;Leave me be.&rdquo;"
