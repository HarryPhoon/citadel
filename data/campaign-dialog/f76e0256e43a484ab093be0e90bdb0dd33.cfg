	"text": "In your dreams, you trudge through a cloud of pitch-black smoke. It&#8217;s all around you, choking, snatching at your every breath. Through it all, you can dimly make out the familiar shape of your father. &ldquo;Pa!&rdquo; You scream the words, yet the sound chokes in the back of your throat, smothered by the turgid smoke. You try with all your might to reach him, but the floor beneath you shifts around like quicksand, and he begins to disappear from view. &ldquo;Please.. don&#8217;t go.&rdquo;."
