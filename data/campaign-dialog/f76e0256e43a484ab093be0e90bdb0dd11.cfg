	"text": "Right then!\" The driver hops down the steps on the back, fastening them up and closing the back flap behind him. You hear the wooden driver&#8217;s seat out-front groan slightly, and the whole cart wobbles slightly as he sits in place. There is a single sharp crack, and the two horses stubbornly whinnie, as the cart lurches forwards. As the wheels begin to rattle along the worn ruts in the trail, you look out one last time through a gap in the fabric towards the farm. Shaking off  a slight nagging doubt, you close your eyes and try to get some rest. As the cart settles into a rhythmic gait, rocking you gently back and forth, you drift off to sleep."
