	"text": "The area opens into a large cavern, several people bound cast to one side. Brutally beaten and likely dead. One lays on his knees in front of a group of figures clad in robes. Your haste affords you no stealth and one of the number turns to you. A young face with the symbol of Rhin atop her chest. She looks at you forlornly. &ldquo;No one was supposed to see this.&rdquo; She motions to several others at her side. &ldquo;Dispose of the intruder.&rdquo; "
