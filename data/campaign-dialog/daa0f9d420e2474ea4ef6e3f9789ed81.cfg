	"text": "&ldquo;Listen fella, we both know &#8217;ow this is gonna turn out, a-ight? So just hand all yer stuff o&#8217;er and then we might not kill ya anyways.&rdquo; The small robed man stands, surrounded, by a decrepit altar. He trembles, like a leaf torn at by a storm, with rage. &ldquo;Y-ou, you godless filth! You dare wear the colours of Minerva?! You foul mercenaries, lured to atrocious acts by base coin, ensnared by your desire for it! I have nothing to give you as a devout servant of Gaea- no, even if I did, I wouldn&#8217;t hand it over to the likes of you!&rdquo; Of the mercenaries surrounding him, the largest steps closer, chuckling. &ldquo;Don&#8217;tcha know there&#8217;s a war going on, oh great &#8217;oly man? Every&#8217;n knows that you priests have mount&#8217;ns of gold hidden away. So do yer&#8217;self a favour an&#8217; hand it over.&rdquo; He edges closer, all traces of merriment in his eyes replaced by a look of grim violence. The pilgrim, beginning to realise his imminent fate, looks about him frantically and happens to spot you as you stand within the doorway. &ldquo;Y-you there! Can&#8217;t you see this travesty? Help m-me in the name of all that is just!&rdquo;"
