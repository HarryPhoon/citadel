	"text": "Two figures loom from the dark. The first, a man, clad in metal armor, face red, gesticulating wildly, a second, a woman, blue robes, arms folded. 

&ldquo;Our claim is staked!&rdquo; The man roars, &ldquo;this iron allows us to reinforce the breaking dam. Our Architect has already been notified.&rdquo;
