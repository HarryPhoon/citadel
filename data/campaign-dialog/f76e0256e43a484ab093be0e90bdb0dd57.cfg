Well then you&#8217;re not coming in, are you?&rdquo; Pete hurriedly steps forward, seeing the defiant look in your eye. &ldquo;We&#8217;re traders!&rdquo; He blurts out. &ldquo;We&#8217;re not looking for any trouble.&rdquo; The guard looks you over once more, looking markedly unconvinced. &ldquo;Look. Just don&#8217;t make any trouble, especially you. Otherwise, our next little chat won&#8217;t be so friendly.
