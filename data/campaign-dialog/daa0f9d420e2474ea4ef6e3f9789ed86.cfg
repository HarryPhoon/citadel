	"text": "A hard fight: the mercenaries were well experienced, hardened by numerous battles. However, you are victorious. Their bodies are strewn around the shrine, their leader sprawled over the altar, his blood congealing amongst the offerings. The robed man huddles amidst the carnage, staring forlornly at the wrecked shrine. As he looks about him, at the destruction caused, the blood spilt, his lower lip quivers. &ldquo;Men, men, these lowly beasts! Nay, worse than beasts; for beasts know not what they do, they know not morality, they kill out of instinct. Yet these despicable... Creatures, mere effigies of good, gods-fearing men, they knowingly cast aside their morals, their very humanity, all for the sake of coin.&rdquo; He looks at you bitterly. &ldquo;I suppose you want something too? Some reward to make your actions &#8217;worthwhile&#8217;?&rdquo;He tosses something onto the ground before you, then turns back to the altar; angrily trying to remove the stiffening body that lies atop it. &ldquo;Go.&rdquo;"
