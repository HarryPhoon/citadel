As you lifted him, the blood began to pour out ever more quickly, collecting in the large pool that surrounds him. Your father speaks again, faintly, his voice barely a whisper. &ldquo;It&#8217;s too late for me, kid.. If you take me with you, they&#8217;ll catch us.. But alone... alone you stand a chance.&rdquo;His eyes are beginning to dim, his grip on you loosening &ldquo;Go.. Quickly, now..&rdquo; With a struggle, he raises his head up, eyes staring intently into yours. &ldquo;I know that.. that you&#8217;ll make your mark.. on this world.. I know it..&rdquo; His eyes flutter shut, and his head slumps forward."
