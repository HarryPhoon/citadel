	"text": "You can barely see in front of you now. The menacing fog closes in upon you, it snatches at each laboured breath you take. Your weapon is too heavy now, much too heavy&#8230; you let it slip from your grasp, fingers uncurling slowly, letting it slide with a dull thud onto the wet earth. A figure rushes out of the gloom, tackles you to your knees. You struggle, the two of you rolling around amongst the muck, the filth, the dismembered bodies, their vacant eyes stare into your own."
