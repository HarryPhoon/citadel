	"text": "Her smile diminishes ever so slightly, before resuming its glow. &ldquo;Well, well! My apologies for mistaking you for some tourist! One gold piece it is.&rdquo; The air stills ever so slightly, a moment passes. Your coin pouch is one gold piece lighter, and you now hold a moist, lukewarm kebab. You are unsure as you subject it to scrutiny: it neither looks or smells particularly good. A slight sense of unease creeps through you once again. Without any conscious thought however, you tear it apart with your teeth and swallow it down with just one or two large gulps. You feel slightly woozy, the world twirling sickeningly before your eyes, before the world is obscured by darkness. The last thing you see is her wide, toothy smile. You wake up in the back of an unfamiliar alley, as the sun begins to sink beyond the horizon. Your skin is clammy and cold as you groggily climb to your feet, head reeling as you are hit by a severe wave of nausea. You deposit the turbulent contents of your stomach upon the grimy floor: some undigested meat, two buttons, and a single strand of thread."
