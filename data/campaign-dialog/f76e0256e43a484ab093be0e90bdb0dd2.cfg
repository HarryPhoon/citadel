	"text": "He gives you a long, hard, stare. &ldquo;Now why would I do that? Taxes been getting steeper recently so I don&#8217;t think you could&#8217;ve stayed around here much longer anyhow.&rdquo; His eyebrows are thoroughly knitted together in a frown, though his eyes betray a slight glimpse of worry. To your surprise, he pulls you forward into an awkward hug, holding you close for a moment, before releasing his grasp abruptly. &ldquo;Off with you now, else you really will miss it.&rdquo;"
