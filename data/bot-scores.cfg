//To use this file, first set bot_type: "omni" in the campaign file for your
//scenario. Then you will be using the 'omni bot', an AI which uses this
//file to be able to play all the different cards available.
//
//The way the bot works is to assign a score to every possible card play.
//Each card has an entry in this file which is used in calculating the
//score for playing it. The bot will calculate the combinations of cards
//it can play in a given situation based on its mana, and will play the
//combination which has the highest score.
//
//Note that the set of available fields is different based on card type:
//creatures, lands, and invocations each have a different set of valid
//fields. Creatures and lands are usually relatively simple and mostly
//just require integer values for things. Invocations tend to require actual
//formulas.
