Our update mechanism publishes Argentum Age through a module system.
This module system only handles files with certain characteristics in the filenames:

Letters, numbers, hypthens, underscores, periods are allowed.
No other characters are allowed. Spaces, commas, colons, etc are not allowed.

Can we please ensure all checked in images and other files meet this criteria? I also recommend not using upper case in filenames.

I recommend just giving images a name which correspond to the card they are used on. E.g. grave-stalker.png
