Modified a photograph of Ted Batchelor which turned up in Google image search for "stuntman on fire", with the usage restrictions set to maximum.
The photograph was modified by using the trace-bitmap feature of inkscape and cropping it. Ted Batchelor is described at this site:

I can't find a specific license for this image, so it might not be legitimate. It seems unlikely that Ted would be upset with us though.
